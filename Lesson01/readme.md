# Lesson 01

## Topics

### Control Structures

If statements
Switch statements

### Loops

For Loop - Manual Iterative Loop
* You have to control the iteration yourself
* You have control of the exit parameters

Foreach Loop - Automated Iterative Loop
* Iterates through the the IEnumerable type provided
* Creates a special scope, so operations may not be as intended

Do While Loop - Post Check Loop
* Runs at least once
* Runs indefinately until exit condition is reached
* Can easily become an infinite loop

While Loop - Pre Check Loop
* May never run loop if condition is false before loop starts
* Runs indefinately until exit condition is reached
* Can easily become an infinite loop
